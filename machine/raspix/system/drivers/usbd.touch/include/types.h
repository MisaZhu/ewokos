		enacted before retrying).
	ErrorIncompatible is a device driver that will not support the detected
		device.
	ErrorCompiler is a problem with the configuration of the compiler generating
		unusable code.
	ErrorMemory is used when the memory is exhausted.
	ErrorTimeout is used when a maximum delay is reached when waiting and an

		will not finish, just that it is unreasonably slow.
	ErrorDisconnected is used when a device is disconnected in transfer.

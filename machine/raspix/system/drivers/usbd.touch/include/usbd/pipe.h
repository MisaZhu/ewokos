/**
	\brief Our implementation of the USB pipe defined in 10.5.1. 

	The UsbPipeAddress holds the address of a pipe. The USB standard defines 
	these as a software mechanism for communication between the USB driver and the
	host controller driver. We shall not have a concept of creating or destroying 
	pipes, as this is needless clutter, and simply just indicate the pipe by its
	physical properties. In other words, we identify the pipe by its physical 
	consequences on the USB. This is similar to Linux, and vastly reduces 
	complication, at the expense of requiring a little more sophistication on the
	sender's behalf.
